## Docker is Amazing

Long time no see. I just want to get something off my chest. Some time ago I
already did some stuff with docker but I had no idea what I'm doing. Recently I
had to try Docker again because I had to work with bleeding edge software,
although I just wanted to compile a document. I started with a basic ubuntu
image and added some stuff to it. Afterwards I wrote a simple Dockerfile to be
able to recreate that container. After reading through the documentation. I must
say, this whole procedure is amazing. Why didn't anybody tell me this before? I
feel I'm missing out on so many more great software. Where can I learn all this?
It's not like I don't have my little hacker space.
